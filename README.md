# MorfinaBot


My old shitty bot

server-dm.js sends messages from servers to direct messages and other way. I used it on my old iPhone4 where discord crashed when i had any server on logged account so i made another one and  bot was sending me all messeages, and when i typed something back bot was sending that message on choosed server

botold.js is old version of bot

bot.js contains new version of bot and server-dm.js

If you have any question just ask
